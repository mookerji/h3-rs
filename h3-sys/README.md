## `h3-sys`: Generated Low-Level Bindings to H3

These are low-level bindings to the H3 C header library, generated by `bindgen`,
and are wrapped by `h3-rs`. A few notes:

- These are committed to source to avoid any complications around longer build
  times, and dependency issues around libclang.
- The version of `h3-sys` tracks the version of H3 (currently v3.6.0).

To regenerate the FFI from the C header, *return to repo* root and run:

```bash
$ make gen
```
