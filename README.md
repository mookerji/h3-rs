## `h3-rs`: Rust Bindings to h3

Rust bindings to [H3][h3_uber], a C library for hexagonal, hierarchical geospatial
indexing.

This is **experimental, in-progress software**.

## Installation

`h3-rs` is available on [crates.io]():

```
[dependencies]
h3 = "0.1.0"
```

`h3-rs` requires that you already have `h3` and its headers installed on your
system. Follow those instructions [from h3][h3_install].
